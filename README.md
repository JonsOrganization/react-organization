## Pages
In Next.js, a page is a React Component exported from a file in the pages directory.

Pages are associated with a route based on their file name. For example, in development:

`pages/index.js` is associated with the `/` route.
`pages/posts/first-post.js` is associated with the `/posts/first-post route`.
We already have the pages/index.js file, so letâ€™s create pages/posts/first-post.js to see how it works.
